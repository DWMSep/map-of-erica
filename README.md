# map-of-erica

The repo contains the RMD file used to create the map of Erica oraria and E.discolor found at the souther tip of Africa.
An interactive map was created which shows where the 2 erica species are found an on which soil types they are found
E.discolor and E.oraria data was pulled for iNaturalist and filtered for un-cultivated plants and that are research grade.
The soil map was downloaded from https://data.isric.org/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/c3f7cfd5-1f25-4da1-bce9-cdcdd8c1a9a9, only the soil data types were used and no other data was incorperated
